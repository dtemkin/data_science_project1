Students will work through  individual or team projects applying course-work
to the full data life cycle within a particular domain. Focus will also be
on best software engineering practices and reproducible research.

- Go over some R  and data science topics.
- I'll go over tools(git, Rmd, notebook, code organization) and best practices in this regard.
- Answer/help students on their project
- Go over some some topics as per students demands

* Grading
  There will be a final project and some coding homework assignments. Worst 1 of your homework assignments
