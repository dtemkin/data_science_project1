  + patch representing each commit.
    *git log -p*

* git remote to see all the repo connections

Fetch content is represented as remote branch and has
no affect on  local development work.

-Use *git branch -r* to see remote branches
- git fetch <remote>
- git fetch <remote> <branch>

You merge from these branches if you like the changes
done by others.  Do  usual git checkout and git merge commands.

- *git diff origin/master* to check the difference
- If you like the change
   *git merge origin/master*

Or Two run one command use
- *git pull origin master*
