## Data science cycle

As we collect project data, we will come back to various part of this cycle.

Let start with **Visualization**

# Visualization using ggplot2

Visualization is one of the most important activity in the  data science. 
 
```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```
**Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines?**

```{r}
class(mpg)
str(mpg)
mpg
```
Let plot engine capacity *displ* and mpg *hwy* to get some idea
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x =displ, y = hwy  ))

```

Clearly as engine size increase mpg decrease. Also there are some outlier in right hand side
- **geom_point::** adds a layer of points to your plot.
- **mapping::** defines how variables in your dataset are mapped to visual properties.
- **aes::** Aesthetics include things like the size, the shape, or the color of your points.
```{r}

# 3.2.4 Exercises 4

plot(mpg$hwy, mpg$cyl, main = "scatter plot", xlab = "mpg", ylab = "cylinder")
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x =displ, y = hwy, color = class  ))

```
Clearly right side points (in red) are 2 seaters. Explaining their high mileage with bigger cylinder. Note when this data set
was created there was no hybird model.

We can map class to size, alpha and shape asthetics too.
Note: mapping unordered variable (class) to an ordered aesthetic (size) is not a good idea

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class))
```
