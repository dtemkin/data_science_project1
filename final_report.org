* Final Project

You can work in a group of at most 2 people.
Final Project requires submission of  .Rmd  file  and a pdf file.

*Apart from the source code, Rmd/notebook must contain following sections.*
*Note: If you dataset is big enough you can subsample it so that you can run the code in reasonable time*

** Task definition (4 points) 
What real world problem you tried to solved. *What is input and output of your system.*
Make sure you project is not too small and not too large.
*I have provided some link in the website for possible places to look for datasets.*
*you are free to do web scrapping if desired datasets is not there.*

** Tools and infrastructure. (4 points) 
- What tools, libraries and language you used.
- What kind of pre processing you did in the data and why?

*Please try to prepare and load the data and see what kind of difficulties you are facing.*

** Evaluation metric (10 points) 
- Data Cleaning activity
- Data Visualization/summary
- What you did about missing values
- What kind of hypothesis you tested to find useful predictor.
- What kind of feature engineering you have to do
- How are you going to finally evaluate your project and metrics involved.(*Model assessment*)

*Above two task are the most important thing in data science. Everything else will be derived from them*

** Your results and conclusion (10 points) 
   How well you method/algorithm did against others. Please report final metrics and error/accuracy analysis here.
