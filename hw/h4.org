We have cleaned up data and have done basic visualization. Let's move ahead with statistical analysis(remaining visualization, hypothesis testing etc.),
model building for prediction or for finding pattern. Please document your finding in the notebook. 

Points(10)
- For Growhouse project, finish KPI and build linear regression model for predicting revenue, boxes.
- For Jury project finish  chi square test, 3 hypothesis testing and building logistic regression model.
- For  rss feed project,  finish lda model building, topics visualization/interpretation, use topic probability distribution as feature for logistic regression and evaluate it.
- If you have image data, finish bounding box model building and evaluate it.
- For Analgesia, finish refinement of statistical analysis.


Please  organize you code and  tag you github repository the way you did for HW3 using *git tag command(Don't forget to push the tag)*

Please start preparing for your final presentation. If you are working in group, each member has to present a portion of the project.

*On 6 th March there will be a 15-20 minutes in class pre-presentation based on current progress.*
*Note: on 13th march there will be final in class presentation and  project report is due on 13th march.*
