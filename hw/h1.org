In this homework, we'll practice some R markdown and data visualization.


*Note*: If you are using Python please submit Jupyter notebook.
You may use *Pandas* or  other library of your choice to do following analysis.
I can help you in setting and basic introduction if you are not familiar with
Jupyter notebook. For visualization *matplotlib or bokeh* can be used.


Task in this  Kaggle competition was to predict Survival given some information
(feature, variable..).

We'll start  our exploratory data analysis starting with each feature.


*Before solving any of the following problem, write a short description of what are*
*you going to do or what is your interpretation of results or visualization.*

*Write the title of your R markdown document.*

-(1 P) Load the Titanic training dataset as done  in first class (01-04-2018) and describe its
field.

-(1 P) Write the code to check if Survival or Pclass is missing some values?

-(1 P) Use *table* command in R to print distribution of Survival.
  
-(1 P) Use *table* command in R to print distribution of Pclass.

-(2 P) Using ggplot, plot the  histogram (use **geom_bar**)  of Pclass with aesthetic property *fill = as.factor(Survival)*. As you can check
  Pclass is an integer with few values, convert it to factor before using  ggplot.

-(2 P) Report any trend you find in this predictor(Pclass) for survival  across class label.
 *Also note the using visual plot are more effective than using table command multiple times and finding pattern*

-(1 P)  For next feature *Name*, print some name and report you finding by looking at the names.

-(4 P) Write a function to extract *titles("Miss", "Master", "Mr", "Mrs", "Other" )* from the *name* field and add a new field into data called *Title*. Use *stringr* library.

-(2 P) Using ggplot, plot the  histogram (use **geom_bar**)  of newly added field *Title* with aesthetic property *fill = as.factor(Survival)*.
  As Title also has few limited values convert to factor before using ggplot.
