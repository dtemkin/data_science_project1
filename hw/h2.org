Hi all now everyone has datasets for the project or downloading it from the web. 
Hw2 is meant to get you started with  project setup using git tool and have basic data pipeline setup.

Complete the following task.

- Create the git repo with project name.

- Add a README.md file with headers describing  *Project objective* and *Milestones per week*.
   Milestones will get revised as per progress and client update. .Rmd and .md has same markdown format.
  *Please send me README.md* if you don't want me to be a contributor in the project otherwise send me an invite
  for being collaborator. If you send me(my git id is *psnegi*) an invite please don't email README.md, I can read it from the repository.

- Most of the projects have excel file sheets.
   -  Write a function for data importing in a separate file called import_tidy.r. 
     Use *readxl* from tidyverse family. It will helps in loading a particular sheet *(sheet = 4 or name of sheet))* and
     using excel cell range convention *range = cell_cols("B:D")*  for specify data range. 
     Look at  *http://readxl.tidyverse.org/* for more information. *For csv file read_csv is good option.*

     - Write an function to get data in tidy format. Write some initial and as we move ahead will improve it.

- If you are downloading data from the web(rss feed or images).
  - functions for importing the data and setting up the pipeline for storing and loading it.
  - functions for cleaning and transforming data. 
     - For text data it can related to normalization operations on the text data.
     - For image data it can be taking care of outlier pixels and normalizing(using $l_2 norm, \infinity norm$ etc.) the data.

*If you already ahead in the project, let me know which portion (file name and line numbers) of your code I should look into.*
*If I am not added to your project, then you need to show code in your computer.*

*Note: Please use some sort of directory structure to manage your code. As I have already mentioned there is no rule for the project structure.*
*I'll recommend keeping data in data directory inside project directory(don't check in  your data to git). Data loading and tidying code in analysis directory*
*As you make progress, .Rmd  or .ipynb files* can be stored in root directory of the project or another folder.
